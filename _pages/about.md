<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Reacting Flow and Numerical Methods Group](https://rockettroopers.wixsite.com/stormtrooper) at the University of Calgary. My research focuses on advancing simulation methodologies to address complex fluid flow problems, particularly in combustion, energy and sustainability applications. I am an expert in leveraging computational methods to drive innovation in fluid mechanics, tackling real-world engineering challenges, and contributing to the development of sustainable technologies.

## Current research projects 
1. Quantification of Hydrogen flashback.
2. Deflagration to detonation transition for hydrogen safety.
3. Optimization of simplified chemistry models.

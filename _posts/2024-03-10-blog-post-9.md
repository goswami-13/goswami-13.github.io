In my previous article, we explored how Python is indespensible for data-analysis in OpenFOAM simulations, and briefly looked into [fluidfoam](https://fluidfoam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a specialized Python package tailored for OpenFOAM post-processing. Fluidfoam simplifies complex tasks like plotting velocity and pressure distributions, handling OpenFOAM-specific data structures seamlessly, and enabling insightful visualizations with minimal effort. It represents a significant advancement in post-processing workflows, empowering users to extract deeper insights from their simulation data. Here is my previous article for reference [here](https://medium.com/stackademic/conquer-openfoam-post-processing-with-the-power-of-function-objects-and-python-3fdcba68f759).

In my previous article, I introduced the basics of fluidfoam, a specialized Python package designed for post-processing in OpenFOAM simulations. In this installment, I'm excited to delve deeper into advanced post-processing techniques using fluidfoam. Specifically, we'll explore three key aspects:

1. Extracting and plotting velocity at probe points.
2. Extracting and plotting force coefficients.
3. Plotting the power spectral density of velocity at probe points and force coefficients.

These advanced techniques will enable us to gain deeper insights into our OpenFOAM simulations and enhance our understanding of fluid dynamics phenomena. So without further ado, let's dive in!

## Ready the case

I'll be demonstrating these post-processing techniques using a simulated flow around a circular cylinder as an example. You can access the example cases for download from [here](https://github.com/goswami-13/OpenFOAM-cases/tree/main/4_Tutorials), identified as `CircularCylinder_Laminar`. While I'll be using this specific case for illustration, the techniques showcased are applicable to any simulation provided there is sufficient data available. For this demonstration, the `CircularCylinder_Laminar` case is initially run until 4000 seconds (`endTime`) to ensure fully-developed flow. Subsequently, the simulation is extended for another 1000 seconds with the inclusion of additional function objects in the `controlDict` under the `functions` sub-dictionary. Specifically, I incorporate function objects probes and forces into the simulation setup, as depicted below:

```bash
functions
{
    #includeFunc probes  

    forces
    {
        type            forceCoeffs;
        libs ( "libforces.so" );
    
        writeControl   timeStep;
        writeInterval  1;
        
        patches         ( "PRISM" );
        
        rho             rhoInf;
        log             true;
        rhoInf          1.225;
        liftDir         (0 1 0);
        dragDir         (1 0 0);
        //sideDir         (0 0 1);
        CofR            (0 0 0);
        pitchAxis       (0 0 1);
        magUInf         0.015;
        lRef            0.1;
        Aref            0.0628;
    }
    
}
```

Here, I'm including the `probes` file below for reference. In situations where you need to monitor multiple probe locations, such as hundreds of points, it's advisable to maintain a separate file named `probes` within your `system` folder and then include this file in the `functions` section of your `controlDict` file. This approach helps maintain clarity and organization in your simulation setup. Here is an example of `probes` file,

```bash
/*--------------------------------*- C++ -*----------------------------------*\
  =========                 |
  \\      /  F ield         | OpenFOAM: The Open Source CFD Toolbox
   \\    /   O peration     |
    \\  /    A nd           | Web:      www.OpenFOAM.com

probes
{
    type            probes;
    libs            ("libsampling.so");

    // Name of the directory for probe data
    name            probes;

    // Write at same frequency as fields
    writeControl    timeStep;
    writeInterval   1;

fields (
        p 
        U 
       );

probeLocations
(

	(0.01 0 0)
	(0.02 0 0)
	(0.03 0 0)
	(0.04 0 0)
	(0.05 0 0)
	
);
    // Optional: filter out points that haven't been found. Default
    //           is to include them (with value -VGREAT)
    includeOutOfBounds  true;
}
// ************************************************************************* //
```

Running the simulations for the last 1000 seconds with function objects will generate a directory named `postProcessing` within your case directory. This `postProcessing` directory will contain the data derived from the function objects, structured as illustrated below:

```bash
postProcessing
├── forces
│   └── 3996.9
│       └── coefficient.dat
└── probes
    └── 3996.9
        ├── U
        └── p
```

## Understanding Probe Data Extraction

To extract and plot the probes, we'll utilize the fluidfoam and matplotlib packages in Python. Let's start by importing the necessary modules. While I typically prefer using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), these steps are also applicable for a Python script (.py).

```python
import matplotlib.colors
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import fluidfoam as fl
import scipy as sp

%matplotlib inline

plt.rcParams.update({'font.size' : 14, 'font.family' : 'Times New Roman', "text.usetex": True})
```

Set a path to your case,

```python
### Path to CircularCylinder_Laminar/postProcessing directory
Path = 'E:/4_Tutorials/CircularCylinder_Laminar/postProcessing'
### Path where to save the figures
save_path = 'E:/4_Tutorials/CircularCylinder_Laminar/'
```

Let's extract the velocity probes. We'll accomplish this using the `readprobes` function from within fluidfoam. With this function, we have the flexibility to extract probe data from all folders within `postProcessing` using the `mergeTime` option, or we can solely extract data from the last-run time directory using the `latestTime` option. In the following example, I'll extract the probes using the `latestTime` option:

```python
### Read Probes of u
probes_locU, timeU, u = fl.readpostpro.readprobes(Path ,probes_name='probes',time_name='latestTime',name='u')
```

This function extracts three main components: probe locations, the corresponding time stamps for each probe, and the velocity components at these probe locations. Probe locations are presented as a numpy array and can be non-dimensionalized as follows:

```python
### Probe Locations 
Locations = probes_locU/0.1
print(Locations)
```

I typically recommend visualizing these probe locations in a tabular format for better comprehension. Since we're dealing with only 5 probes in this example, I'll print out these locations here. They appear in the format (x, y, z):

```python
[[0.1 0.  0. ]
 [0.2 0.  0. ]
 [0.3 0.  0. ]
 [0.4 0.  0. ]]
```

The velocity at these probe locations is extracted in the format: `u[probes list (all or index), Probe location (from Probes_locU), velocity components (ux, uy, uz) = (0,1,2)]`. This means the first index of u represents the list of all velocities, the second index signifies the index-location of the probe, and the third index represents the velocity components as `(ux, uy, uz) = (0, 1, 2)`.

You can plot the velocity at any probe location using the following method:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(timeU, u[:, 4, 0], label=r'$u$')
ax.axhline(np.mean(u[:, 4, 0]), color='k', linestyle='--', label=r'$\overline{u}$')

ax.set_ylabel(r'$u$ (m/s)')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$t$ (s)')

ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('both')
ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('both')

ax.legend(loc = 'center left', frameon = False, bbox_to_anchor = (1, 0.5))


plt.savefig(save_path + 'probeVelocity.jpeg', dpi = 300, bbox_inches = 'tight')

plt.show()
```

## Understanding Force Coefficient Extraction

In the same way, we can plot the force coefficients by,

```python
### extract the force coefficients
forces_Coefficients = fl.readpostpro.readforce(Path,namepatch='forces',time_name='mergeTime',name='coefficient')
### Create a pandas dataframe for better column organization
### In the pressent case, the column titles are copied from the coefficient file.
df = pd.DataFrame(forces_Coefficients, columns=['Time','Cd','Cs','Cl','CmRoll','CmPitch','CmYaw','Cdf','Cdr','Csf','Csr','Clf','Clr'])

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize = (12,4))

ax = axes[0]

ax.plot(df.Time, df.Cd, label=r'$C_d$')
ax.axhline(np.mean(df.Cd), color='k', linestyle='--', label=r'$\overline{C_d}$')

ax.set_ylabel(r'$C_d$')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$t$ (s)')

ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('both')
ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('both')

ax.legend(loc = 'upper right', frameon = False) # or 'best', 'upper right', etc

ax.set_xlim(3900, 5400)

ax = axes[1]

ax.plot(df.Time, df.Cl, label=r'$C_l$')
ax.axhline(np.mean(df.Cl), color='k', linestyle='--', label=r'$\overline{C_l}$')

ax.set_ylabel(r'$C_l$')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$t$ (s)')

ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('both')
ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('both')

ax.legend(loc = 'upper right', frameon = False) # or 'best', 'upper right', etc

ax.set_xlim(3900, 5400)

plt.savefig(save_path + 'Forces.jpeg', dpi = 300, bbox_inches = 'tight')

plt.show()

```

## Power spectral density of velocity and force coefficient

The power spectral density characterizes the power contained within a signal across different frequencies. In wake studies conducted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), power spectral density is employed to identify dominant frequencies within the flow, often used to estimate the Strouhal number - a non-dimensional frequency parameter. The Strouhal number (St) is computed as St = f*L/U, where f represents the vortex shedding frequency, L denotes the characteristic length scale, and U signifies the free-stream velocity. Generating the power spectrum of velocity at specific probe locations involves:

```python
### FFT 

### Constants
d = 0.1
Ub = 0.015
dt = 0.2
fs = 1/dt

Signal1 = u[:, 4, 0]

### PSD using welch
f1, Eu1 = sp.signal.welch(Signal1, fs, nfft = len(Signal1), nperseg=len(Signal1)/2, window='hamming')
St1 = f1*d/Ub

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.loglog(St1, Eu1, label = (r'$\bf E_x$'))

### Mark and print the dominant frequency
xmax = St1[np.argmax(Eu1*f1/(Ub**2))]
print("Strouhal Number = ", xmax)
ax.axvline(xmax, c='r', ls='--', lw=0.8)

ax.legend(loc='best', frameon = False); # or 'best', 'upper right', etc
ax.set_xlabel(r'$St$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'$E_{u_i}$')
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('both')
ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('both')

plt.savefig(save_path + 'Power.jpeg', dpi = 300, bbox_inches = 'tight')

plt.show()
```

<figure>

</figure>

To compute the power spectrum of the coefficient of drag, simply substitute the signal with `df.Cd`, as demonstrated below:

```python
### FFT 

### Constants
d = 0.1
Ub = 0.015
dt = 0.2
fs = 1/dt

Signal1 = df.Cd

### PSD using welch
f1, Eu1 = sp.signal.welch(Signal1, fs, nfft = len(Signal1), nperseg=len(Signal1)/2, window='hamming')
St1 = f1*d/Ub

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.loglog(St1, Eu1, label = (r'$\bf E_{drag}$'))

### Mark and print the dominant frequency
xmax = St1[np.argmax(Eu1*f1/(Ub**2))]
print("Strouhal Number = ", xmax)
ax.axvline(xmax, c='r', ls='--', lw=0.8)

ax.legend(loc='best', frameon = False); # or 'best', 'upper right', etc
ax.set_xlabel(r'$St$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'$E_{u_i}$')
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(direction='in', which='both')
ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('both')
ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('both')

plt.savefig(save_path + 'PowerDrag.jpeg', dpi = 300, bbox_inches = 'tight')

plt.show()
```

<figure>

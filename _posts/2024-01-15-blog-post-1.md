Accodring to wikipedia, "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)  is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows." In the 
realm of CFD, simulations are conducted using either commercial or open-source tools to model, estimate, and predict fluid flow without the necessity for physical experiments. Consequently, CFD emerges as 
a potent tool for comprehending and resolving real-world physical processes, encompassing internal flows like those in pipes/channels and external flows such as aerodynamics around vehicles/structures. To 
delve into these simulations, one must acquaint themselves with various CFD tools. Commercial packages like ANSYS, Star CCM+, and COMSOL, as well as open-source counterparts like OpenFOAM, NEK5000, and 
SU2, offer diverse options. While commercial tools furnish robust simulations and user-friendly interfaces with visually appealing outputs, open-source tools, exemplified by OpenFOAM, grant freedom of use 
contingent on an understanding of the underlying mechanics within the blackbox.

OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation And Manipulation) stands out as a widely adopted C++ based toolbox for CFD. Its popularity has soared in recent years, evident in its extensive user base and endorsements 
from notable companies such as Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, and Intel, among others. The tool's prevalence extends to academic research, particularly in fields like turbulence, exa-scale modeling, and 
general problem-solving. However, mastering OpenFOAM involves overcoming a steep learning curve, demanding advanced user expertise to align critical physics with numerical algorithms. However, delving 
into OpenFOAM is not a walk in the park. It entails a substantial learning curve, requiring users to possess a level of advanced expertise in identifying crucial physics, and effectively aligning them 
with numerical algorithms. To elaborate further, one must grasp the underlying physics of the specific problem at hand, navigate intricacies like meshing, pre-processing, and post-processing within the 
CFD workflow, and only then address pivotal concerns surrounding verification and validation.

This article marks the initial installment in a series aimed at guiding CFD enthusiasts and new researchers through the realm of Computational Fluid Dynamics, specifically with OpenFOAM. The author, 
Shubham Goswami, a PhD researcher at the University of Alberta specializing in the study of flow around obstacles (to put it crudely), shares insights gained through personal experiences in CFD. These 
articles serve as a valuable starting point for individuals embarking on their CFD journey, offering guidance on the intricacies of the field, from understanding physics to tackling challenges in 
verification and validation.
